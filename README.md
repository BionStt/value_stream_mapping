<h2><a name="introduction">What is value stream mapping?</a></h2>

Value stream mapping is a lean-management method for analyzing the current state and designing a future state for the series of events that take a product or service from its beginning through to the customer. At Toyota, it is known as "material and information flow mapping".[1] It can be applied to nearly any value chain.

<h2><a name="metrics">VSM metrics</a></h2>

In order of importance.

* Process Time (PT)

  * A.k.a. touch time, work time, cycle time.

  * The time it takes to actuall perform the work, if a person is able to work on it fully and focus on it fully.

  * Include task-specific doing, talking, thinking, etc.

* Lead Time (LT)

  * The elapsed time from when the input to a step is available, until the step is compeleted i.e. the work is sent along to the next step.

  * A.k.a. throughput time, turnaround time, elapsed time.

  * Include Process Time, not just the waiting time.

* % Activity

* Rolled first pass yield

* Number of Handoffs (#HO)

* Number of IT Systems (#IT)

* Freed capacity
